New Rain Resort Rainwater Harvesting Project 

New Rain Limited, project proponent (PP) is committed to the construction and maintenance of the 
earth dam and connected drainage systems. The proponent ensures the successful operation and 
maintenance of the earth dam, which is designed to capture and store rainwater runoff from a 3km long 
stormwater drain on the access road to the project site. The stored water is used for herb farm an 
greenhouse irrigation, and for the supply of water to the resort. The proponent is responsible for 
maintaining the catchment area and ensures the smooth flow of rainwater to the earth dam. They also 
ensure the prevention of wastage and the efficient use of the harvested water. 

Objective: The major objective was to make The New Rain Resort and its farms self-sustaining by 
leveraging rainwater harvesting and without putting additional load on the localized underground 
aquifers. 

Outcome: A 30,000 cubic meter triangular earth dam and piping from roadside stormwater drains have 
been built to harvest rainwater run-off from a 1.4km patch of tarmac road. The harvested water has 
enabled the project proponent to reduce their dependency on groundwater and council water for the 
operations of the resort and its farms; this in turn has reduced the aggregate cost of water to the project 
proponent.
